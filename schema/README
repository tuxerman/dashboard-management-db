# You will need PGCRYPTO

The system does very little error checking at present, but if you've made
the dependencies (too many to list), the following should create a good 
db.

make createall

If you wish to create a database not named after you, you can set the 
DB environment variable, e.g.

make DB=mytest createall

PLEASE NOTE - DON'T DO THIS ON A PRODUCTION SYSTEM YET. IT WIPES OUT THE DATABASE.

make DB=captown reallyclean
